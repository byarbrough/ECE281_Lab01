#####Analysis

The simulation performed exactly as it was supposed to. Given three inputs A, B, C, the circuit produced three outputs X, Y, Z. These simulated outputs matched the truth table. What's more, this serves as a converter for a 3 bit two's compliment number.

X = Σ(1, 2, 3, 4)

Y = Σ(1, 2, 5, 6)

Z = Σ(1, 3, 5, 7)
